  <p> My most recent project is in <strong>/textBasedAdven/textBasedAdven.cpp</strong>, it's a project where the user enters the dungeon and plays a turn-based exploration system.</p>
  <p> I also created a bash-like system in <strong>/cpp/bash.cpp</strong> where it detects the user's system (UNIX, Windows, etc) and attempts to retrieve the system username and password (asks the user to enter details if unable to fetch) and creates a bash console. </p>


  <h1> textBasedAdven </h1>
  <p>You enter a username (can't just be numbers, defaults to Player1 then) and then the game starts. At the start of the game, you get the options to enter 3 doors with something that will happen to you when you enter the door. After that, you can view your inventory,       your stats, or continue onto the next part of the game. You'll then enter a boss fight where you can figure out the basics of how the fighting mechanics work in the game, and later encounter a wave-like event, which is common in this game.</p>

  <h1> Java programs </h1>
  <p> If you go through my Java programs, you'll realise that Main.java is incomplete; that's because I abandoned the project. I attempted to create a game where the user travels in a car and has to reach a destination while fighting problems, such as oil leaks, bandits, etc. I realised this game would be nearly impossible to make on the command line console while looking user-friendly (the non-user-friendly version is a lot easier). Making a GUI version of it would be much simpler, but since I mostly program during school hours when I get bored on Codespaces, I can't use the necessary Java library to run the GUI handler.</p>
